# CS5229 Advanced Computer Networks - Programming Assignment 2

This repository hosts the distribution package of Programming Assignment 2 for the NUS CS5229 Advanced Computer Networks course.

Please find the detailed description readme file of each task under the corresponding folder.

## Assignment Package
### Part A: Baby Steps in P4 (8%)
There are two exercises, namely "A-1: Multicast" and "A-2: Secret Message Exchange" which can be found from the respective subfolders.

Each exercise will constitute 4% each -- total of 8%.

### Part B: Distributed Machine Learning Gradient Aggregation with Programmable Switch (SwitchML) (10%)
Part B consist of only one exercise, see the folder `part_b/switchml`.

This exercise constitutes to 10% of your final grades.

## Submission
You should only submit `multicast.p4`, `secret.p4` and `switchml.p4` to the designated folders created on Canvas.

This Assignment is a strictly individial work.

## Credits
This assignment is constructed by adapting the build scripts and PTF examples that are publicly available at [p4-guide](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide) by Andy Fingerhut. 

In addition, we also adapt existing scripts and tools from p4lang's [P4 Tutorials](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master) which made it easy to create new exercises.

This assignment is inspired by NSDI 2021 [Scaling Distributed Machine Learning with In-Network Aggregation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/sapio).
